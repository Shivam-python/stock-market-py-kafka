# Stock market Data Engineering Project
Real-time stock market analysis using python &amp; Kafka

## Idea
Simulation of how real time data from stock market APIs is pulled & consumed in data pipeline for analysis & usage

### Key Components : 
* Indexed Data : Collected sample stock data for simulation

* Kafka : Used to produce stock market data (Simulate stock market API)

* S3 storage : Where files will be pushed for analysis later. (Still working on what needs to be done to this data).
